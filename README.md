How to use vicon to communicate with your ROS
-----
We need a router to help the computer connect with vicon: close DHCP function and insert both vicon and your computer into the ethernet interface.
<br> Then we need to put vicon and your computer under one network segmentï¼šthe default IP address of vicon is 192.168.10.1, so we can configure the router's IP address(now we uses it as a switch) as 192.168.10.254 and your computer's IP address as 192.168.10.253.
<br> Now, all the hardware connection is finished.

How to use this repository
---
This repository consists of three packages, `ardrone_autonomy` is the driver of ardrone which is the basis of all ardrone project; `vicon_bridge` is created to connect ROS with vicon and receive data. These two packages have been created by some genius long before.
<br> `ardrone_vicon` is a package that performs several functions based on these two packages. You can get started quikly using the following command:
First, we need to create a ROS workspace:
```
mkdir vicon
cd vicon
mkdir src
cd src
catkin_workspace_init
cd ..
catkin_make
```
Then, you can download packages:
```
cd src
git clone https://github.com/Shicheng-Liu/ardrone_vicon.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```
Finished!
