How to use vicon to communicate with your ROS
-----
For now, you have _vicon_ and two computers: one is ubuntu computer and the other one is windows computer where the _vicon tracker_ is installed.<br>
We need a router to help the computers connect with vicon: close DHCP function and insert both vicon and your computers into the ethernet interfaces.
<br> Then we need to put vicon and your computers under one network segmentï¼šthe default IP address of vicon is 192.168.10.1, so we can configure the router's IP address(now we uses it as a switch) as 192.168.10.254 and your ubuntu computer's IP address as 192.168.10.253. Your windows computer is 192.168.10.1 since it has _vicon tracker_ already been installed before.
<br> Now, all the hardware connection is finished.
<br>

Download and set up workspace
---
This repository consists of three packages, `ardrone_autonomy` is the driver of ardrone which is the basis of all ardrone projects; `vicon_bridge` is created to connect ROS with vicon and receive data. These two packages have been created by some genius long before.
<br> `ardrone_vicon` is a package that performs several functions based on these two packages. You can get started quikly using the following command:
<br>First, we need to create a ROS workspace:
```
mkdir vicon
cd vicon
mkdir src
cd src
catkin_workspace_init
cd ..
catkin_make
```
Then, you can download packages:
```
cd src
git clone https://github.com/Shicheng-Liu/ardrone_vicon.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```
Finished!
<br>You may also want to add path to the evironment:
```
gedit ~/.bashrc

///add this line at the bottom
source ~/vicon/devel/setup.bash
```
Make your change into effect:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

How to use functions
--
Before using _ardrone_vicon_, make sure you have followed all the steps above successfully.
<br> Open _vicon tracker_ and choose object, connect the WIFI of your ardrone.
<br> Open a terminal:
```
roslaunch ardrone_vicon ardrone.launch
```
Open another terminal:
```
rosrun ardrone_vicon ardrone_vicon_node
```
Since we have added path to the environment, we have no need to source the environment now. Now you will see a menu like this:
        
   ![menu](https://github.com/Shicheng-Liu/ardrone_vicon/blob/master/menu.png)
<br>
Choose y to take off is always the first step, and then you can choose functions you want.
